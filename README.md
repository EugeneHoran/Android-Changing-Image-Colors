# Android-Changing-Image-Colors

Changing image colors through xml and programmatically. Great for changing googles white material icons. 

**Get Material Icons:**  https://github.com/google/material-design-icons

**Material Icon Previews:** http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/

**NOTE: All the images are white icons from the Google link above** Rite now I only have it working with white images to match the exact color on versions less than v21.
I need to read more into the documentation.
I will update it if I find a way to change the colors regardless of the image color.
